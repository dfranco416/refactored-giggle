# Testing Math Contoller through Heroku Deployment

Here I created a REST controller called MathController which is a simple operation of adding two int values together. The way the values are input is by using the getMapping annotation and grabbing the inputed values in the URIs. After this was created, I created a few test cases to ensure that the code worked properly. 

Below is the link to the heroku deploy that soley returns the values that are put after the add URI.
